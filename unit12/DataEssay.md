I think that most data collection is unavoidable by companies, but ToS and Privacy agreements need to be more accessible. For example, [Creative Commons lisences](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/igo/) are very technical and hard to understand, but they provide you with a "human readable" summary of the license. Legitimate companies lose nothing by doing this as they are still legally protected by their policies (which are not replaced by the summaries). This encourages openness from companies about what they are collecting and how they are using it. In addition, it becomes obvious in a summary if there is something suspicious because it can't be hidden behind 50 pages of legalese. If these summaries were required and punishable if they are misleading or false, I think that many more consumers would read the policies they are agreeing to. 
In the current environment, companies are going to collect data no matter what, and they will not change their ToS and privacy policy language for fear of losing legal protection. Because of this, I think the best way to protect consumers is by forcing short, readable, accurate, but non-binding summaries of policies to be available.
