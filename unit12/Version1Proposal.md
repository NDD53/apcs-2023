# My Proposal v1

Noah Dunham

## The Plan

I am going to build a problem generator for the math team. This will cover some basic number theory, algebra, and trig problems. I will try to have a tiered system for the difficulty, but who knows...

## The Challenges

There are already great sites that can produce much better results than I (think [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/trigonometry), [Brilliant](https://brilliant.org/courses/ace-the-amc/), and [AOPS](https://artofproblemsolving.com/alcumus)). In order for this to be useful, I need to tackle topics not found on any of these sites (especially AOPS). This means some obscure geometry and algebra that will be hard to find the solutions to.

## The Steps

1. Figure out what types of problems are useful but not covered on other sites. (1 hour)
2. Write the structure for several problems that use the same essential knowledge but are different from eachother. (5 hours)
3. Write a program to generate a problem and solve it, making sure all the numbers are reasonable. Alternatively, I could figure out how to store and read problems that are pre made in a file. Maybe I do both. Who knows? (5-20 hours)
4. Recieve a user input and determine if the error they made was conceputal or computational.(4 hours)
5. Offer tips if the error is conceptual. (6 hours)

## The Learning 

- try/catch stuff with errors in user inputs
- break/continue for skipping problems or changing problem difficulty (I don't fully know the structure of the code yet)
- hashmaps for storing problem/solution pairs
- If I have time, whatever I need to get this out of github and into a browser
