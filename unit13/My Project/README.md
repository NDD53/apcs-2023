## Project Description

I wrote some code on surrounding Simon's Favorite Factoing Trick (SFFT for short). SFFT is a pretty intuitive extention of completing the square, which is taught in algebra. SFFT is frequently used in math competitions, but I didn't get to cover it extensivley this year during the math team meetings. 
My code (hopefully) can teach you SFFT, starting from easy factoring up to a pretty complicated math problem. 

## What I learned

I learned:
 - The basics of regular expressions.
 - How to parse user inputs using regular expressions.
 - What hashmaps are, when to use them, and when not to.
 - What the ? operator does.
 - How to use try/catch statments.
 - You should make the code as adaptable and general as possible to future changes to the project. 

## Why this cool

### Why SFFT is cool

You can easily find ALL the times that an equation like 3xy + 15x - 42y + 108 = 0 crosses through integer (x,y) coordinates using a simple trick. If you don't think this is cool, I can't help you.

### Why my code is cool

It can tell you if your answer is correct, as well as help you identify some mistakes. Also, it uses recursion to interpret whatever goofy parentheses you used in your input.

## How you can try it

Don't.

Instead, learn SFFT through [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nN3H7w2LnI) or [this site](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Simon%27s_Favorite_Factoring_Trick). After that practice on [AOPS](https://artofproblemsolving.com/alcumus) by signing up, pressing play --> change focus --> algebra (in the top right corner) --> Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick (in settings set problem difficulty to easy). While my code works and will get you there, It uses random numbers to generate simple problems that are often not fun, even for me. You will learn much better through AOPS. 

If you enjoyed SFFT, you should consider joining math team. We do fun problems using cool tricks (like SFFT), and even get to compete against other schools. We do not care about your prior math experience or what class you are in :)

If you really want to, just open a codespace and run SFFT.java
